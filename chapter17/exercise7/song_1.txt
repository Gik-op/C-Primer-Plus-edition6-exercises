You and I under different stars
You dream a lot and I keep chasing the past
To remind you of who we are
You've been gone for a while
In a distance another time
When you lay with me in the stillness of night
I'm there where we used to be calling out
calling out
Lay down, lay down on my shoulder
Take me to the water
Let's not talk it over
Islands in an ocean
Silence is broken
Lay down on my shoulder as if we were still closer
But we're too far
Drifting too far
But we're too far
Drifting too far
